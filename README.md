# Thermostat

> Explainability in NLP is becoming more important by the day and is getting explored on many different levels. In order to perform linguistic and statistical analysis of the output of explainability methods, expert knowledge is needed. It further induces both an implementational on the developer and a computational burden on the hardware. We propose **Thermostat**, a collection of heatmaps that can be downloaded by researchers and practitioners. This work is a dataset paper that combines popular text classification datasets and state-of-the-art language models with explainability methods commonly applied to NLP tasks. By offering pre-computed saliency maps of these datasets stemming from a variety of explainers, we help to prevent repetitive execution yielding similar results and therefore mitigate the environmental and financial cost.

**Thermostat** combines explainability methods from the `captum` library with Hugging Face's `datasets` and `transformers`.

### Config files

jsonnet config files have the following naming convention:
`<DATASET_ID>_<EXPLAINER_ID>_<MODEL_ID>.jsonnet` where
